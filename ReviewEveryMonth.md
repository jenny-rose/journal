Buster Benson's guidelines/principles for antifragility

1. Stick to simple rules
2. Build in redundancy and layers (no single point of failure)
3. Resist the urge to suppress randomness
4. Make sure that you have your soul in the game
5. Experiment and tinker — take lots of small risks
6. Avoid risks that, if lost, would wipe you out completely
7. Don’t get consumed by data
8. Keep your options open
9. Focus more on avoiding things that don’t work than trying to find out what does work
10. Respect the old — look for habits and rules that have been around for a long time

REMEMBER: Think long-term. The long game. Don't sweat the small things. Think in terms of months, years, decades (not hours, days, week). Quantity time with loved ones, projects you're passionate about, and core values/beliefs (not day-to-day grievances, pettiness). Don't waste energy on the inconsequential. Keep it simple, stupid!
