#### Things to Read Before You Start

[MIT Open Courses: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/) - A free course on basic computer science offered by MIT. I think you're selling yourself short if you don't have at least a basic understanding of computer science if you're taking on any tech-related job, and that includes front-end web development.

[The Job of a Front-End Developer](http://www.onlinetools.org/articles/fed2.html) - "It's a hybrid position, you are someone that paints with code. Programmers don't accept your work as real code, and designers don't consider it design."

[A Baseline for Front-End Developer](http://rmurphey.com/blog/2012/04/12/a-baseline-for-front-end-developers/) - You're not just making things pretty with HTML and CSS. Your skill base needs to be much larger if you want a job.

[Web Developer Checklist](http://webdevchecklist.com/) - Exactly what it says. This will give you a better idea of what exactly is expected of the sites you write up.

[How to Learn to Code in 2013](http://blog.enoughtobedanger.us/how-to-learn-to-code-in-2013/) - Don't set a vague goal of "learn to code".

[Please Don't Learn to Code](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html) - Don't learn to code merely for the sake of learning to code.

#### Weapon of Choice: Your Tools

#### Learning HTML and CSS

[Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com) - A great jumping point. Simple lessons plus a built-in editor lets you see how HTML and CSS affect a document. You will not walk away from Codecademy job-ready, and you definetly won't know how to make a complete website. This is simply a way to wet your appetite and give you some working knowledge before diving into other material.

[A Practical Guide to HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/) - Shay Howe provides resources at the end of each lesson
