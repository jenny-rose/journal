### Resolutions in 2013

__Learn to program/code__: Especially front-end development. I want a career in web design/development. Tie together my haphazard education into something coherent and demonstrable. The biggies that I want to focus on:

>+ SASS
>+ Javascript & Javascript design patterns
>+ Ruby/Ruby on Rails
>+ Learn Git/version control
>+ Familiarize self with Twitter Bootstrap and HTML5 Boilerplate
>+ Learn how to create a Wordpress theme from scrap
>+ Run personal site/blog on Octopress

__Learn how to read__: No, I know how to read. But not really, truly read. Read less material, but make the material I do read matter. Focus on classic literature, meaningful blogs, coding-related material that will enrich my skillset. Read deeply, not widely. Stop being so obsessed with reading more than everyone else: it's really not an indication of anything
