While enjoying some beers on my birthday, my friend J. told me he wanted "to do what I was doing", ie: _teach himself HTML and CSS_. At the time I was kind of tongue-tied because I just knocked back a giant glass of Blue Moon, not to mention I had a hard time trying to figure out just where someone should start. I started with taking a book on HTML out of the school library in middle school. Ever since then it was an on-again, off-again relationship with coding and scripting, until I finally decided to stop merely flirting with the idea as an adult and really commit. In all that time you amass resources without really trying. It almost happens by accident.

So this is my attempt to list off some starting points. These are the very basics, focusing on the two pillars of a website, HTML and CSS. 

#### Things to Read Before You Start

[The First Step is Start](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2538-the-first-step-is-to-start) - Starting is always the hardest part. Ideas on how to get over fear of the metaphorical first blank page.

[MIT Open Courses: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/) - A free course on basic computer science offered by MIT. I think you're selling yourself short if you don't have at least a basic understanding of computer science if you're taking on any tech-related job, and that includes front-end web development.

[The Job of a Front-End Developer](http://www.onlinetools.org/articles/fed2.html) - "It's a hybrid position, you are someone that paints with code. Programmers don't accept your work as real code, and designers don't consider it design."

[A Baseline for Front-End Developer](http://rmurphey.com/blog/2012/04/12/a-baseline-for-front-end-developers/) - You're not just making things pretty with HTML and CSS. Your skill base needs to be much larger if you want a job.

[Web Developer Checklist](http://webdevchecklist.com/) - Exactly what it says. This will give you a better idea of what exactly is expected of the sites you write up.

[How to Learn to Code in 2013](http://blog.enoughtobedanger.us/how-to-learn-to-code-in-2013/) - Don't set a vague goal of "learn to code".

[Please Don't Learn to Code](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html) - Don't learn to code merely for the sake of learning to code.

#### Your Tools

_Text Editor_: This is where you'll write your code. You can be as minimal and sparse as Notepad or as complicated as Visual Studio. I prefer a happy, free medium. My weapon of choice is [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2), which can be as simple or as involved as you want it to be. Brandon Keepers has a great [starting guide](http://opensoul.org/blog/archives/2012/01/12/getting-started-with-sublime-text-2/) for it over on his blog. 

Another editor worth looking into is [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), an open-source editor geared towards front-end web developers. It's open-source and built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The thing I love the most about it is that it connects directly to the Chrome browser for live previews: as you edit your CSS, the changes will be pushed to the browser. HTML files need to be saved before they'll be pushed, however. [A guide](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Use-Brackets) on how to use Brackets is available on Github.

_Browser_: [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) or [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox). Don't forget their respective developer tools - [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/) and [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/). They'll make troubleshooting your code a breeze when problems bubble up.

#### Learning HTML and CSS

[Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com) - A great jumping point. Simple lessons plus a built-in editor lets you see how HTML and CSS affect a document. You will not walk away from Codecademy job-ready, and you definetly won't know how to make a complete website. This is simply a way to wet your appetite and give you some working knowledge before diving into other material.

[A Practical Guide to HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/) - Shay Howe provides resources at the end of each lesson so you can dig deeper on the concepts presented.

[30 Days to Learn HTML and CSS](https://tutsplus.com/course/30-days-to-learn-html-and-css/) - Free 30-day course available over on Tuts+. Taught by Jeffrey Way, whose tutorials I have thoroughly abused.

[HTML Dog](http://htmldog.com/) - Tutorials, references, and articles, oh my!

[Skillcrush 101](http://skillcrush.com/2013/01/25/announcing-two-february-sections-of-skillcrush-101) Geared towards my fellow ladies, Skillcrush 101 will get you from zero to launching your own site in two weeks. Virtual office hours with the instructors and a discussion group with your fellow students will be provided. Not bad for $75!

[Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Documentation on pretty much everything web development related.

#### Blogs and Websites to Follow

[A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com/) - Probably THE most important website out there on web development and design. Subscribe to keep up on the new articles, but please, dig through the archives as well. They have a [handy primer](http://alistapart.com/article/ALAprimer) for new readers. I've been reading this blog since I was a wee one of 18 or so (I'm 27 now!).

[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) - Questions? Stack Overflow is where everyone goes for answers, whether you work on software, games, or the web. If it's code-related, it's here. Don't forget to browse the [HTML](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html) and [CSS](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/CSS) tags before posting your question.

#### Other Thoughts

Bother people. Ask questions. Abuse Google, the Stack Overflow tags I just linked, and communities like [r/webdev](http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev), [r/web_design](http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design), and [/r/learnprogramming](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming). Find someone to talk at and/or to. Despite all the stereotypes, you really can't afford to be a complete shut-in if you want to learn and grow. I'm the poster child for loners everywhere, and even I do my best to bounce things off of my boyfriend when I'm stuck: not only because he's a genius with an answer for everything, but because it helps to explain the problem out loud (there's an adorable name for this, called [rubber duck problem solving](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/03/rubber-duck-problem-solving.html)). More often than not, I have the answer before he even has a chance to reply.

And most importantly: do! Make your first sloppy, ugly, badly coded website. And another. And another. And another. On the days you don't feel like coding, check your RSS feeds or stick your nose in a book. Burned out on reading about code? Read about design, or psychology, or story-telling, or on becoming a better learning. One of my favorite instructors at CCAD told my portfolio class one day that there's a difference between giving up and stopping: giving up on our art was unacceptable, but putting down the camera or the paintbrush was fine, so long as we were still immersing ourselves in it in some other format (even if it was just discussing that new gallery show over some beers). 

Don't use your learning material as a crutch: you have to make things to learn things. Good luck!
