#### Things to Read Before You Start

[The First Step is Start](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2538-the-first-step-is-to-start) - Starting is always the hardest part. Ideas on how to get over fear of the metaphorical first blank page.

[MIT Open Courses: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/) - A free course on basic computer science offered by MIT. I think you're selling yourself short if you don't have at least a basic understanding of computer science if you're taking on any tech-related job, and that includes front-end web development.

[The Job of a Front-End Developer](http://www.onlinetools.org/articles/fed2.html) - "It's a hybrid position, you are someone that paints with code. Programmers don't accept your work as real code, and designers don't consider it design."

[A Baseline for Front-End Developer](http://rmurphey.com/blog/2012/04/12/a-baseline-for-front-end-developers/) - You're not just making things pretty with HTML and CSS. Your skill base needs to be much larger if you want a job.

[Web Developer Checklist](http://webdevchecklist.com/) - Exactly what it says. This will give you a better idea of what exactly is expected of the sites you write up.

[How to Learn to Code in 2013](http://blog.enoughtobedanger.us/how-to-learn-to-code-in-2013/) - Don't set a vague goal of "learn to code".

[Please Don't Learn to Code](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html) - Don't learn to code merely for the sake of learning to code.

#### Your Tools

_Text Editor_: This is where you'll write your code. You can be as minimal and sparse as Notepad or as complicated as Visual Studio. I prefer a happy, free medium. My weapon of choice is [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2), which can be as simple or as involved as you want it to be. Brandon Keepers has a great [starting guide](http://opensoul.org/blog/archives/2012/01/12/getting-started-with-sublime-text-2/) for it over on his blog. 

Another editor worth looking into is [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), an open-source editor geared towards front-end web developers. It's open-source and built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The thing I love the most about it is that it connects directly to the Chrome browser for live previews: as you edit your CSS, the changes will be pushed to the browser. HTML files need to be saved before they'll be pushed, however. [A guide](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Use-Brackets) on how to use Brackets is available on Github.

#### Learning HTML and CSS

[Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com) - A great jumping point. Simple lessons plus a built-in editor lets you see how HTML and CSS affect a document. You will not walk away from Codecademy job-ready, and you definetly won't know how to make a complete website. This is simply a way to wet your appetite and give you some working knowledge before diving into other material.

[A Practical Guide to HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/) - Shay Howe provides resources at the end of each lesson so you can dig deeper on the concepts.

[HTML Dog](http://htmldog.com/) - Tutorials, references, etc.

[30 Days to Learn HTML and CSS](https://tutsplus.com/course/30-days-to-learn-html-and-css/) - Free 30-day course available over on Tuts+. taught by Jeffrey Way

[Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Documentation on pretty much everything web development related.

#### Blogs and Websites to Follow

[A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com/) - Design and development, web standards, best practices, etc. 

[24 Ways](http://24ways.org/) - An advent calendar for web developers. For every day in December, they release a new article.

[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) - Questions? Stack Overflow is where everyone goes for answers, whether you work on software, games, or the web. If it's code-related, it's here. Don't forget to browse the [HTML](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html) and [CSS](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/CSS) tags before posting your question.
